    There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice
    had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she
    walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.

    There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice
    had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she
    walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.
    Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;
    there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought
    was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either
    the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would
    not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low
    curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about
    fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her
    great delight it fitted!
